# ISPM 31

A lot to be sampled should be a number of units of a single commodity identifiable by its homogeneity in factors such as:

.pull-left[
- origin
- grower
- packing facility
- species, variety, or degree of maturity
- exporter
]

.pull-right[
- area of production
- regulated pests and their characteristics
- treatment at origin
- type of processing.
]

# The Regulator

Suppose the regulator is happy to apply a compliance rule across an entire consignment. Then:

- the *consignment* is compliant if the sample (across multiple lines) returns no contaminated items
- if contaminated items are found, the *whole* consignment is rejected

# The Problem

.bigr[
How then, do we sample from each line, without making assumptions about individual line prevalences?
]

--

# The Solution

.bigr[
<span style="color:#f92672">By sampling proportional to the line volumes.</span>
]

---

# The Setup

Assume there are $K$ lines, with $N_{k}$ units in the $k$<sup>th</sup> line making a total of $N = \sum_{k} N_{k}$ units. If the contamination rate in line $k$ is $p_{k}$ then the joint contamination rate, $p$, satisfies $\sum_{k} N_{k} p_{k} = N \cdot p$.

Fix the total number of units sampled $n$, and choose some fixed weights $w_{k}$ such that $\sum_k w_{k} = 1$ and $n_{k} = n w_{k}$.

The sensitivity of inspection is
$$
\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

---

# The Line Prevalences

With our sample size $n$ and weights $w_{k}$ fixed, we can find the line prevalences that will minimise the sensitivity as
$$
\begin{align}
  1 -  p_{k} = (1 - p) w_{k} \frac{N}{N_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

--

> Note: this is true for any set of fixed weights, and should alert you to what form the $w_{k}$ should take!

Thus, if we take our weights as proportional to the line volumes, sensitivity is *minimised* when all line prevalences are equal to the joint contamination rate $p$.

---

# The Sample

Recall the sensitivity:
$$
\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

Substituting $p_{k} = p$, gives the familiar sample size formula:
$$
\begin{align}
  n = \log(1 - S) / \log(1 - p)
\end{align}
$$

Which we divvy up by sampling (at random) $n_{k} = n\frac{N_{k}}{N}$ units from line $k$.

# Sample Size Calculations for Phytosanitary Testing of Small Lots of Seed

# The Problem


Minimal infected material is required to transmit viruses and diseases, so we want to be *really* sure we detect contamination if present.

- Common design parameters:
  - $p=0.1\%$
  - $S=0.95$

# Focussing on the Line

What if there's only 1500 seeds in the consignment?

--

We commonly appeal to the Hypergeometric distribution, $X \sim \text{Hypergeometric}(x, m, N, n)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\Pr(X = x) & = \frac{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}{{N \choose n}} \text{, for } x \in 0, 1, \ldots, \min\{m, n\}
\end{align}
$$

Where $X$ is the number of contaminated seeds present in a sample of size $n$, that is drawn from a lot of size $N$ containing $m$ contaminated seeds.

---

# Example

With design parameters and lot size:

- $p=0.1\%$
- $S=0.95$
- $N=1500$

we would *expect* there to be 1.5 contaminated seeds in the lot. .bigr[`r emo::ji("thinking")`]

<hr>

--

It's common to *round down* so that we assume in fact we have 1 contaminated seed. This obviously changes our design prevalence; it is now `r formatC(1 / 1500 * 100, format = "f", digits = 2)`%.
