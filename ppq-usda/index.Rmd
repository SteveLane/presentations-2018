# ISPM 31

A lot to be sampled should be a number of units of a single commodity identifiable by its homogeneity in factors such as:

.pull-left[
- origin
- grower
- packing facility
- species, variety, or degree of maturity
- exporter
]

.pull-right[
- area of production
- regulated pests and their characteristics
- treatment at origin
- type of processing.

# The Regulator

Suppose the regulator is happy to apply a compliance rule across an entire consignment. Then:

- the *consignment* is compliant if the sample (across multiple lines) returns no contaminated items
- if contaminated items are found, the *whole* consignment is rejected

# The Problem

.bigr[
How then, do we sample from each line, without making assumptions about individual line prevalences?
]

--

# The Solution

.bigr[
<span style="color:#f92672">By sampling proportional to the line volumes.</span>
]

---

# The Setup

Assume there are $K$ lines, with $N_{k}$ units in the $k$<sup>th</sup> line making a total of $N = \sum_{k} N_{k}$ units. If the contamination rate in line $k$ is $p_{k}$ then the joint contamination rate, $p$, satisfies $\sum_{k} N_{k} p_{k} = N \cdot p$.

Fix the total number of units sampled $n$, and choose some fixed weights $w_{k}$ such that $\sum_k w_{k} = 1$ and $n_{k} = n w_{k}$.

The sensitivity of inspection is
$$
\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

---

# The Line Prevalences

With our sample size $n$ and weights $w_{k}$ fixed, we can find the line prevalences that will minimise the sensitivity as
$$
\begin{align}
  1 -  p_{k} = (1 - p) w_{k} \frac{N}{N_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

--

> Note: this is true for any set of fixed weights, and should alert you to what form the $w_{k}$ should take!

Thus, if we take our weights as proportional to the line volumes, sensitivity is *minimised* when all line prevalences are equal to the joint contamination rate $p$.

---

# The Sample

Recall the sensitivity:
$$
\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}
$$

Substituting $p_{k} = p$, gives the familiar sample size formula:
$$
\begin{align}
  n = \log(1 - S) / \log(1 - p)
\end{align}
$$

Which we divvy up by sampling (at random) $n_{k} = n\frac{N_{k}}{N}$ units from line $k$.

# The Problem


Minimal infected material is required to transmit viruses and diseases, so we want to be *really* sure we detect contamination if present.

  - $p=0.1\%$
  - $S=0.95$

# Focussing on the Line

What if there's only 1500 seeds in the consignment?

--

We commonly appeal to the Hypergeometric distribution, $X \sim \text{Hypergeometric}(x, m, N, n)$.

$$
\begin{align}
\Pr(X = x) & = \frac{{m \choose x} {{N-m} \choose {n-x}}}{{N \choose n}} \text{, for } x \in 0, 1, \ldots, \min\{m, n\}
\end{align}
$$

Where $X$ is the number of contaminated seeds present in a sample of size $n$, that is drawn from a lot of size $N$ containing $m$ contaminated seeds.

---

# Example

With design parameters and lot size:

- $p=0.1\%$
- $S=0.95$
- $N=1500$

we would *expect* there to be 1.5 contaminated seeds in the lot. .bigr[`r emo::ji("thinking")`]

<hr>

--

It's common to *round down* so that we assume in fact we have 1 contaminated seed. This obviously changes our design prevalence; it is now `r formatC(1 / 1500 * 100, format = "f", digits = 2)`%.

# Leakage

.center[

# What is the Expected Leakage?

Intuitively, sometimes we select a sample that does not contain any contaminated seeds, *even though the consignment does*. This happens with probability $\Pr{}(X=0)$<sup>&dagger;</sup>.

Sometimes, we do actually get some contaminated seeds in our sample; this happens with probability $\Pr{}(X>0)$.

.footnote[

<sup>&dagger;</sup>Where $X$ is the number of contaminated seed in the sample as we defined previously.

If we **don't detect** any contaminated seeds, then $p \times (N - n)$ contaminated will be <span style="color:#f92672">leaked</span> on average. If we **detect** some of the contaminated seeds, then 0 seeds are leaked (the whole consignment is rejected).

Putting these together, the average number leaked is
$$
\begin{align}
p \times{} (N - n) \times{} \Pr{}(X=0)
\end{align}
$$

# The Average Leakage Rate

# So What?

# Maximum Average Leakage Rate

### How to set it?

```{r leakage-example}
eml <- function(n, N) ((n / (n + 1))^n) / (n + 1) * (N - n) / N
pcfvd <- (1/0.19) / 20 / 2500
pcfvdN <- min(which(eml(1:(2500 - 1), 2500) < pcfvd))
pcfvd2 <- (1/0.19) / 20 / 10000
pcfvdN2 <- min(which(eml(1:(10000 - 1), 10000) < pcfvd2))

```

Suppose for a particular pathway there are 20 lots of 2500 seeds per year on average, and that a particular disease has a seed-to-seedling transmission rate of 19%. If contaminated, approximately $0.19 \times 20 \times 2500=`r 0.19*20*2500 `$ seeds would be capable of transmitting the disease if contaminated.

Assume that we are willing to allow the possibility of at most $c=1$ seed contaminated, to actually transmit the disease per year. We would thus set the maximum average leakage rate for the pathway at $1 / 9500 = `r pcfvd * 100`$%.

.footnote[
This is clearly just one example of how a maximum average leakage rate could be set.
]

---

# Choosing a Sample Size

We can show that the maximum average leakage rate for sample size $n$ and lot size $N$ is
$$
\begin{align}
  \max E(a) & = \frac{1}{n+1} \frac{N}{N - n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{n}
\end{align}
$$

1. Set $n_{0} = 1$;
2. Calculate $\max E(a) | n_{0}$ (in the Equation above);
3. Repeat the following until $\max E(a) | n_{k}$ is less than the allowable leakage rate:
  - Set $n_{k} = n_{k-1} + 1$;
  - Calculate $\max E(a) | n_{k}$.
4. Use $n_{k}$ as calculated in Step 3 as the optimal sample size.

---

# Back to the Example

Recall we said we'd be willing to allow the possibility of at most $c=1$ seed contaminated, to actually transmit the disease per year, and our maximum average leakage rate was set at `r pcfvd * 100`%. Assume we have an incoming lot of size 2500. Using the previous algorithm, we find that $n = `r pcfvdN`$ should be sampled.

```{r example-leakage}
apm2 <- leakageRate(p, 2500, pcfvdN)
opar <- par(mar = c(5, 2, 4, 2) + 0.1, oma = c(0, 5, 0, 0))
plot(p, apm2, type = "l", bty = "l", ylab = "", yaxt = "n")
abline(h = pcfvd, col = "darkgreen", lty = 2)
axis(2, at = yAt, labels = yLab, las = 1)
title(ylab = "Leakage rate", outer = TRUE)
par(opar)

```

# Why is this Cool?

## Two Reasons

.bigr[
<span style="color:#f92672">Because the focus is on the whole pathway, not just a particular consignment,</span>

and

<span style="color:#f92672">Because it allows us to focus on impact, not convention.</span>
]

---

# Duality with Convention

```{r duality-calcs}
confHyper <- function (p, N, n) {
    mL <- max(1, floor(p * N))
    mU <- max(1, ceiling(p * N))
    if (mL == mU) {
        conf <- 1 - dhyper(0, mL, N - mL, n)
    } else {
        confL <- 1 - dhyper(0, mL, N - mL, n)
        confU <- 1 - dhyper(0, mU, N - mU, n)
        ## Linear interpolation
        pU <- p * N - mL
        pL <- 1 - pU
        conf <- pL * confL + pU * confU
    }
    conf
}
pAPM <- p[which.max(apm2)]
confAPM <- confHyper(pAPM, 2500, pcfvdN)

```

Of course, we could always turn this back in to a conventional setting. If the design contamination rate is `r pAPM * 100`%, then sampling `r pcfvdN` seeds from a lot of 2500 has sensitivity `r round(confAPM*100, 1)`% *for that particular lot*.

```{r example-duality}
plot(p, apm2, type = "l", bty = "l", ylab = "", yaxt = "n")
abline(h = pcfvd, col = "darkgreen", lty = 2)
abline(v = pAPM, col = "darkgreen", lty = 2)
axis(2, at = yAt, labels = yLab, las = 1)
title(ylab = "Leakage rate", outer = TRUE)
par(opar)
