# ISPM 31

A lot to be sampled should be a number of units of a single commodity identifiable by its homogeneity in factors such as:

.pull-left[
- origin
- grower
- packing facility
- species, variety, or degree of maturity
- exporter
]

.pull-right[
- area of production
- regulated pests and their characteristics
- treatment at origin
- type of processing.

# The Regulator

Suppose the regulator is happy to apply a compliance rule across an entire consignment. Then:

- the *consignment* is compliant if the sample (across multiple lines) returns no contaminated items
- if contaminated items are found, the *whole* consignment is rejected

# The Problem

.bigr[
How then, do we sample from each line, without making assumptions about individual line prevalences?
]

--

# The Solution

.bigr[
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;By sampling proportional to the line volumes.&lt;/span&gt;
]

---

# The Setup

Assume there are `\(K\)` lines, with `\(N_{k}\)` units in the `\(k\)`&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; line making a total of `\(N = \sum_{k} N_{k}\)` units. If the contamination rate in line `\(k\)` is `\(p_{k}\)` then the joint contamination rate, `\(p\)`, satisfies `\(\sum_{k} N_{k} p_{k} = N \cdot p\)`.

Fix the total number of units sampled `\(n\)`, and choose some fixed weights `\(w_{k}\)` such that `\(\sum_k w_{k} = 1\)` and `\(n_{k} = n w_{k}\)`.

The sensitivity of inspection is
$$
`\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}`
$$

---

# The Line Prevalences

With our sample size `\(n\)` and weights `\(w_{k}\)` fixed, we can find the line prevalences that will minimise the sensitivity as
$$
`\begin{align}
  1 -  p_{k} = (1 - p) w_{k} \frac{N}{N_{k}}
\end{align}`
$$

--

&gt; Note: this is true for any set of fixed weights, and should alert you to what form the `\(w_{k}\)` should take!

Thus, if we take our weights as proportional to the line volumes, sensitivity is *minimised* when all line prevalences are equal to the joint contamination rate `\(p\)`.

---

# The Sample

Recall the sensitivity:
$$
`\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - p_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}`
$$

Substituting `\(p_{k} = p\)`, gives the familiar sample size formula:
$$
`\begin{align}
  n = \log(1 - S) / \log(1 - p)
\end{align}`
$$

Which we divvy up by sampling (at random) `\(n_{k} = n\frac{N_{k}}{N}\)` units from line `\(k\)`.

# Line-based Sensitivity

We can just replace the line prevalences with `\(q_{k}=p_{k} s_{k}\)`:
$$
`\begin{align}
  S = 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{K} (1 - q_{k}) ^ {n_{k}}
\end{align}`
$$

Everything else works out, with weights and overall sensitivity adjusted for the imperfect detection:
$$
`\begin{align}
  q &amp; = \frac{N p}{f} \\
  w_{k} &amp; = \frac{n}{f} \frac{N_{k}}{s_{k}} \\
  \text{where } f &amp; = \sum_{k}^{K} \frac{N_{k}}{s_{k}}
\end{align}`
$$

# Sample Size Calculations for Phytosanitary Testing of Small Lots of Seed

# The Problem


Minimal infected material is required to transmit viruses and diseases, so we want to be *really* sure we detect contamination if present.

- Common design parameters:
  - `\(p=0.1\%\)`
  - `\(S=0.95\)`

&lt;hr&gt;

Requires a sample size of approximately &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;3000&lt;/span&gt;!

# Focussing on the Line

What if there's only 1500 seeds in the consignment?

--

We commonly appeal to the Hypergeometric distribution, `\(X \sim \text{Hypergeometric}(x, m, N, n)\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
\Pr(X = x) &amp; = \frac{{{m \choose x}} {{N-m} \choose {{n-x}}}}{{{N \choose n}}} \text{, for } x \in 0, 1, \ldots, \min\{m, n\}
\end{align}`
$$

Where `\(X\)` is the number of contaminated seeds present in a sample of size `\(n\)`, that is drawn from a lot of size `\(N\)` containing `\(m\)` contaminated seeds.

---

# Example

With design parameters and lot size:

- `\(p=0.1\%\)`
- `\(S=0.95\)`
- `\(N=1500\)`

we would *expect* there to be 1.5 contaminated seeds in the lot. .bigr[ðŸ¤”]

&lt;hr&gt;

--

It's common to *round down* so that we assume in fact we have 1 contaminated seed. This obviously changes our design prevalence; it is now 0.07%.

# Leakage

.center[
&lt;img src="img/flow.png" height="400"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
]

---

# What is the Expected Leakage?

Intuitively, sometimes we select a sample that does not contain any contaminated seeds, *even though the consignment does*. This happens with probability `\(\Pr{}(X=0)\)`&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;.

Sometimes, we do actually get some contaminated seeds in our sample; this happens with probability `\(\Pr{}(X&gt;0)\)`.

.footnote[

&lt;sup&gt;&amp;dagger;&lt;/sup&gt;Where `\(X\)` is the number of contaminated seed in the sample as we defined previously.

]

&lt;hr&gt;

--

If we **don't detect** any contaminated seeds, then `\(p \times (N - n)\)` contaminated will be &lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;leaked&lt;/span&gt; on average. If we **detect** some of the contaminated seeds, then 0 seeds are leaked (the whole consignment is rejected).

Putting these together, the average number leaked is
$$
`\begin{align}
p \times{} (N - n) \times{} \Pr{}(X=0)
\end{align}`
$$

# The Average Leakage Rate

Leakage rate for lots of size `\(N=2500\)`, sample sizes of `\(n \in \{500, 600, \ldots, 1200\}\)`.

# Maximum Average Leakage Rate

### How to set it?



Suppose for a particular pathway there are 20 lots of 2500 seeds per year on average, and that a particular disease has a seed-to-seedling transmission rate of 19%. If contaminated, approximately `\(0.19 \times 20 \times 2500=9500\)` seeds would be capable of transmitting the disease if contaminated.

Assume that we are willing to allow the possibility of at most `\(c=1\)` seed contaminated, to actually transmit the disease per year. We would thus set the maximum average leakage rate for the pathway at `\(1 / 9500 = 0.011\)`%.

.footnote[
This is clearly just one example of how a maximum average leakage rate could be set.
]

---

# Choosing a Sample Size

We can show that the maximum average leakage rate for sample size `\(n\)` and lot size `\(N\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \max E(a) &amp; = \frac{1}{n+1} \frac{N}{N - n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n+1}\right)^{n}
\end{align}`
$$

1. Set `\(n_{0} = 1\)`;
2. Calculate `\(\max E(a) | n_{0}\)` (in the Equation above);
3. Repeat the following until `\(\max E(a) | n_{k}\)` is less than the allowable leakage rate:
  - Set `\(n_{k} = n_{k-1} + 1\)`;
  - Calculate `\(\max E(a) | n_{k}\)`.
4. Use `\(n_{k}\)` as calculated in Step 3 as the optimal sample size.

---

# Back to the Example

Recall we said we'd be willing to allow the possibility of at most `\(c=1\)` seed contaminated, to actually transmit the disease per year, and our maximum average leakage rate was set at 0.011%. Assume we have an incoming lot of size 2500. Using the previous algorithm, we find that `\(n = 1458\)` should be sampled.

# Why is this Cool?

## Two Reasons

.bigr[
&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;Because the focus is on the whole pathway, not just a particular consignment,&lt;/span&gt;

and

&lt;span style="color:#f92672"&gt;Because it allows us to focus on impact, not convention.&lt;/span&gt;
]

---

# Duality with Convention



Of course, we could always turn this back in to a conventional setting. If the design contamination rate is 0.068%, then sampling 1458 seeds from a lot of 2500 has sensitivity 75.3% *for that particular lot*.
